Create a program that asks the user for a file name.
If the file name is a text file (the file name ends with “.txt”), print all the lines, and the line number of all the lines that do not end with a dot.
If the file is a numbers file ( the file name ends with “.numbers”) print the line number, and the average of the numbers in each line, and the average of all of the averages.

For example:

words.txt

The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants.
In the present, Odin's son Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard
His brother Loki, attempts to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order,
Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by Loki.
