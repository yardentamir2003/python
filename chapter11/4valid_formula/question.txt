Write a program that checks if a math formula is correct. The formula can use numbers, variables, and the operators +,-,*,/ for example:

Enter formula: a + b
The formula is valid.
Enter formula: a ++ b
The formula is NOT valid.
Enter formula: a+5.4  * 40 / g
The formula is valid.
Enter formula: a /b+.6   - 42 - t +0.5
The formula is valid.
Enter formula: -1-2+6.6.6.6
The formula is NOT valid.

To test this, use an input file with many examples, and make sure the program is correct for each.
