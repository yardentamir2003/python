Q3:
In the lemmings language, there are strict rules!
1. You must not say the same word twice.
2. Each word can have only the following letters: b,d,o,e
3. Each word must be longer than the previous word in the sentence.
4. The amount of sequential o,e must be the same in the word, and must be according to the word position. The first word - only one, the second word - only two, and so on.
5. A word can always be without o,e
6. A sentence must end with a dot.

Your job is to get a story from input.txt, and for each sentence, print if it is valid, and if it is not, in which word is the problem.

For example: input.txt:
bob deed booodeeed.
b dd bbb dddd bbdbdd.
b boob
deed deedoob.
b b b.


Output:
Sentence #1 is valid
Sentence #2 is valid
Sentence #3 is invalid: missing dot at the end
Sentence #4 is invalid: word #1 is invalid
Sentence #5 is invalid: word #2 already exists



To test this, use an input file with many examples, and make sure the program is correct for each.
