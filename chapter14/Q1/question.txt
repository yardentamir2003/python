Q1:
Create a logs investigation program.
Use OOD (Object Oriented Design).
The program should be user friendly, and provide informative errors for any mistake that the user might make.

Make sure to include unit tests for as many functions as possible.
Do not use test.txt files, but write the unit tests only in the code.

The program starts with the following menu:

1. Add logs from file
2. Show logs
3. Update logs
4. Save logs to file
5. Quit

Main option #1
===========
The program asks for a log file path, and loads all the logs to the memory.
In case there are already logs entries in the memory, the log entries from the file are ADDED to the existing.
In case of error of loading of a specific log line, show error with full details, and then skip the next line and try to continue the loading.
After loading the logs from the file, show the menu again.


The log file contains lines, each line is a JSON formatted message.
Example of a log line (will be in a single line, but for readability is shown in multiple lines):
{
  "timestamp": 1651654827,
  "severity": "WARN",
  "service": "gatekeeper",
  "user": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName":"Doe"
  },
  "message": "Out of memory in process"
}

Timestamp is the epoch time (seconds passed since 1/1/1970 GMT)
Severity is one of: ERROR,WARN,INFO,VERBOSE
Service is the name of the related component which logged the log entry
User contains first name and last name. The user entry is optional - and will appear only on some of the log entries
Message is the description of the issue


Main option #2
============
Show the following menu:

Total 45467 messages in the memory.
1. List all logs and all fields
2. List only specific fields
3. Select timezone for logs(Current time zone is UTC)
3. Back to the main menu


#1 - will print all the logs and all of the fields
#2 - will ask the user to select which fields to show, and print all the logs entries with the related fields. For example:
No fields are selected, Select fields to show. (timestamp,severity,service,gatekeeper,firstName,lastName,message):
> timestamp
Selected fields [timestamp], Select fields to show, or click Enter to show the list.
(severity,service,gatekeeper,firstName,lastName,message):
> message
Selected fields [timestamp,message], Select fields to show, or click Enter to show the list.
(severity,service,gatekeeper,firstName,lastName):
#3 will allow the user to select UTC or local time zone

Main option #3
===========
Show the following menu:

Total 45467 messages in the memory.
1. Delete messages by field value
2. Delete all messages
3. Keep message by field value

Example for #1:
Enter field to delete by (timestamp,severity,service,gatekeeper,firstName,lastName,message):
> service
Enter value to delete by:
> gatekeeper
345 messages deleted

(and then back to the menu)


Main option #4
===========
The program asks for a log file path, and saves all the logs to the file.
