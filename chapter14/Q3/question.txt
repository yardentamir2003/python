=== Question 013_actors2 ===
Copy the previous question files.
Create a new file named actors.py
The file should include a new class named Actors.
The Actors class should contain the field actors_list.
The Actors class should contain the methods: list_by_age(), add_actor(), delete_actor(), delete_movie().
Notice that the actors_list should not be sent as a parameter to functions, since it is a field.
Use the new Actors class from the main.
