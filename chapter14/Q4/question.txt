=== Question 014_the_queen2 ===
Copy question 11 files.
As you have noticed, we send the queen_row and the queen_col to almost all functions.
Letâ€™s use objects here as well, like we did on question 13.
Create a class named Board.
The class should have the following fields: queen_row, queen_col
Move all the functions from the main to be methods on the Board class,
and remove the queen_row, queen_col from the methods (use the fields instead).
