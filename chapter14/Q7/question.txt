=== Question 016_library===
Create a management system for the neighborhood library.
The management system is handled by the local librarian who holds all the books on shelves.
Each reader pays an annual payment and then can take up to 2 books every time. The books must be returned within a month.

The following functionalities are required:
Books Inventory Management System
Readers Management System

For the books management the following is required:
Add new book (book name, author name, number of copies, bookshelf number)
Delete book copy or all copies of the book
Search book by name, or by author - prints the book location or the reader if it is used

For the readers management the following is required:
Add new reader (reader name), will create reader ID
Add annual payment for a reader ID
Show books by reader ID
Search reader ID by name
List all readers whose subscription will expire in less than a month
Borrow book
Return book

The system manages 2 files:
books.json
readers.json

The following classes are required:

Library
Properties:books, readers, history (each of the properties is an object)
Methods: show_books_menu, show_readers_menu

Books
Properties: books (list of objects)
Methods: add_book, delete_book, search_book

Book
Properties: name, copies, shelf_number (can be None in case used by a reader), reader (can be None in case not used by a reader)
Methods: borrow_book(gets a reader object parameter),return_book(gets a reader object parameter)

Readers
Properties: readers (list of objects)
Methods: add_reader, add_payment, list_reader_books, list_ids_by_name, list_expired, borrow_book(gets books object as parameter), return_book

Reader
Properties: ID, name, payment_due_date, books (list of book objects)
Methods: list_books, borrow_book, return_book


Notes:
Validate all user input
Any update should recreate the files
Block invalid operations: do not allow to borrow the same book twice before it is released, do not allow to borrow a book if the reader subscription has expired, do not allow to borrow more than 2 books, and anything else which is an erroneous action.
Reader ID will be automatically generated by the system, and must be unique
