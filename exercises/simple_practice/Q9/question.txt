Create a program that draws a board with a player coin on it.
The board size is 4X4.
Empty place is shown as O.
The player coin is shown as X.
Every time, ask for directions from the user: up, left, right, down, or quit.
In case the move is valid, draw the new board.
Otherwise, print an error message.
The coin in the start is located in the upper right corner.

For example:

XOOO
OOOO
OOOO

Enter your move: down
